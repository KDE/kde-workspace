Important:
* improve symkey2ucs - it's quite out of date!
* display tooltip for each key with key description from symbol file

Good to have:
* read keyboard geometry and show it properly instead of default keyboard
* use some common parser to parse symbol and geometry descriptions

Cleanup:
* clean up the code (especially kbpreviewframe.cpp)
