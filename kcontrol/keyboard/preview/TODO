Important:
* display tooltip for each key with key description from symbol file

Good to have:
* read keyboard geometry and show it properly instead of default keyboard
* use some common parser to parse symbol and geometry descriptions
* replace symkey2ucs with something more reliable (e.g. XLookupString?)

Cleanup:
* clean up the code (especially kbpreviewframe.cpp)
