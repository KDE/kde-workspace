Current status of Kickoff/KDE 4:
Bugs and missing features (indicated with a '-')
are listed in priority order for each category.
================================================

Favorites View
	+ Works
    - Favorites are not remembered correctly between sessions
      when Kickoff is run from a Plasma applet
	- Missing drag and drop of items from other views into favorites
	- Missing drag and drop re-arranging of items

Applications View
	+ Works.
	+ When KDE 3 and KDE 4 versions of an application are available only 
          the KDE 4 one is shown.
	- Oxygen application category icons are not shown next to categories

My Computer View
	+ Works.
	+ Uses Solid to query devices and respond to addition or removal of 
	  devices
    - Folders are currently opened in Konqueror.  They should open in
      Dolphin

Recently Used (History?) View
	+ Works
	- Missing a suitable icon for the tab

Leave View
	+ Log-off, Shutdown and Restart work
	- Sleep, Hibernate do not work
    - Log-off, Shutdown and Restart show an unnecessary confirmation
      dialog which gives users the Log-off/Shutdown/Restart choice again
	- Missing icons for the Sleep, Shutdown, Restart actions

Search View
    + Application search by name, generic name or keywords works
	- Strigi search doesn't work due to a Strigi problem which Jos' is
      presently fixing
    * The other search handlers that query Bookmarks,
	  Contacts etc. should probably be shared with KRunner.  This needs
	  mailing list discussion.

Presentation
    + When used as a Plasma applet the Kickoff window does not
      appear and disappear smoothly.  (Works okay when standalone
      Kickoff application is run) [Also Performance?]
	- Missing the custom QTabBar styling to draw the view names
	  under their icons and draw a pretty gradient
	- Missing the "username on computer" text
	- Missing the branding logo
	+ Experimented with multiple columns in the Favorites/My Computer/Recently Used/Leave
	  views.

Performance:
    - Scrolling up and down in the application view is not as smooth
      as it should be in some categories.  Perhaps an issue with icons
      from certain sources?
    - When opening a previously unopened application category there 
      may be a slight delay and HDD activity causing the scrolling animation
      to have few frames (the animation duration is not affected)
    - Currently no delayed initialization is performed.  The data required
    for all tabs is loaded on startup, except the application view where
    only the root branch is loaded initially.
