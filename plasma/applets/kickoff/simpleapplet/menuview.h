 * as a hierarchical menu.
 *
 * When the menu is executed and an item is triggered, the model index associated with the 
 * chosen item can be found by calling indexForAction() with the triggered action.  The action
 * associated with a particular model index can be found using actionForIndex().
 *
 * MenuView creates actions for parts of the model on demand as the user explores the menu.
 * The type of action created for leaf items in the tree can be changed by re-implementing
 * createLeafAction().  When a new action is created or if the corresponding model
 * index's data changes, updateAction() is called to set the action's properties.  This
 * can be reimplemented in sub-classes to change the appearance of the actions.
