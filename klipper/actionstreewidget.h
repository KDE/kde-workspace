    // this property is int instead of (more logical) bool, because we need a custom handling of
    // "default state" and because of our custom use of this property:
    //
    // We indicate that changes were made to this widget by changing this int value.
    // We use it as "if this value is *CHANGED SOMEHOW*, this means that some changes were made to action list",
    // If we'd make this property bool, KConfigDialog would highlight "Defaults" button whenever
    // this property becomes false, but this is not the way we use this property.
    // So we change it from 0 to 1 periodically when something changes. Both 0, 1 values indicate
    // change.
    //
    // We set it to default only when resetModifiedState() is called, i.e. when Apply btn is being
    // clicked
    //
    // Hope this explains it.
    // Yeah, this class is a trick :) If there's a better way to properly
    // update KConfigDialog buttons whenever "some change occurs to QTreeWidget", let me know (dimsuz)
