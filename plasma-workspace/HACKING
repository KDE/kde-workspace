Understanding the Code
======================
Various design documents can be found in the design/ directory and API documentation
generated from the headers is hosted at http://api.kde.org.

Finding the Team
================
You can find the Plasma team on:

    * our development mailing list at plasma-devel@kde.org
    * our irc channel in #plasma on irc.freenode.net

Coding Style
============
New code should follow the kdelibs hacking style, as found here:

    http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style

Existing code that does not follow this style should be migrated over during
editting.
