/**
 * Apps Data Engine
 *
 * FIXME
 * This engine provides information regarding tasks (windows that are currently open)
 * as well as startup tasks (windows that are about to open).
 * Each task and startup is represented by a unique source. Sources are added and removed
 * as windows are opened and closed. You cannot request a customized source.
 *
 * A service is also provided for each task. It exposes some operations that can be
 * performed on the windows (ex: maximize, minimize, activate).
 *
 * The data and operations are provided and handled by the taskmanager library.
 * It should be noted that only a subset of data and operations are exposed.
