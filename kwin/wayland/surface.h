/**
 * @short Wayland Surface implementation.
 *
 * This class represents a Wayland Surface. The Surface is created by the @link Server and managed
 * by that one. The current implementation assumes that one Wayland client may have exactly one
 * Surface, which might be wrong.
 *
 * The class holds a Wayland resource which is added to the Wayland client. Wayland uses the
 * resource to add a buffer to the surface through the surface attach callback. Also the resource is
 * used to notify the server about damaged areas. It seems like the callbacks for damage and surface
 * attach are always invoked when the Wayland client updates the surface.
 *
 * The Surface is linked to a @link Wayland::Client. The lifetime of both is the same.
 * The @link Wayland::Client represents a Client to @link KWin::Workspace, while the Surface holds
 * the Wayland relevant parts of the Wayland "window".
