/** @defgroup kwineffects KWin effects library
 * KWin effects library contains necessary classes for creating new KWin
 * compositing effects.
 *
 * @section creating Creating new effects
 * This example will demonstrate the basics of creating an effect. We'll use
 *  CoolEffect as the class name, cooleffect as internal name and
 *  "Cool Effect" as user-visible name of the effect.
 *
 * This example doesn't demonstrate how to write the effect's code. For that,
 *  see the documentation of the Effect class.
 *
 * @subsection creating-class CoolEffect class
 * First you need to create CoolEffect class which has to be a subclass of
 *  @ref KWin::Effect. In that class you can reimplement various virtual
 *  methods to control how and where the windows are drawn.
 *
 * @subsection creating-macro KWIN_EFFECT macro
 * To make KWin aware of your new effect, you first need to use the
 *  @ref KWIN_EFFECT macro to connect your effect's class to it's internal
 *  name. The internal name is used by KWin to identify your effect. It can be
 *  freely chosen (although it must be a single word), must be unique and won't
 * be shown to the user. For our example, you would use the macro like this:
 * @code
 * KWIN_EFFECT(cooleffect, CoolEffect)
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection creating-buildsystem Buildsystem
 * To build the effect, you can use the KWIN_ADD_EFFECT() cmake macro which
 *  can be found in effects/CMakeLists.txt file in KWin's source. First
 *  argument of the macro is the name of the library that will contain
 *  your effect. Although not strictly required, it is usually a good idea to
 *  use the same name as your effect's internal name there. Following arguments
 *  to the macro are the files containing your effect's source. If our effect's
 *  source is in cooleffect.cpp, we'd use following:
 * @code
 *  KWIN_ADD_EFFECT(cooleffect cooleffect.cpp)
 * @endcode
 *
 * This macro takes care of compiling your effect. You'll also need to install
 *  your effect's .desktop file, so the example CMakeLists.txt file would be
 *  as follows:
 * @code
 *  KWIN_ADD_EFFECT(cooleffect cooleffect.cpp)
 *  install( FILES cooleffect.desktop DESTINATION ${SERVICES_INSTALL_DIR}/kwin )
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection creating-desktop Effect's .desktop file
 * You will also need to create .desktop file to set name, description, icon
 *  and other properties of your effect. Important fields of the .desktop file
 *  are:
 *  @li Name User-visible name of your effect
 *  @li Icon Name of the icon of the effect
 *  @li Comment Short description of the effect
 *  @li Type must be "Service"
 *  @li X-KDE-ServiceTypes must be "KWin/Effect"
 *  @li X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name effect's internal name as passed to the KWIN_EFFECT macro plus "kwin4_effect_" prefix
 *  @li X-KDE-PluginInfo-Category effect's category. Should be one of Appearance, Accessibility, Window Management, Demos, Tests, Misc
 *  @li X-KDE-PluginInfo-EnabledByDefault whether the effect should be enabled by default (use sparingly). Default is false
 *  @li X-KDE-Library name of the library containing the effect. This is the first argument passed to the KWIN_ADD_EFFECT macro in cmake file plus "kwin4_effect_" prefix.
 *
 * Example cooleffect.desktop file follows:
 * @code
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Cool Effect
Comment=The coolest effect you've ever seen
Icon=preferences-system-windows-effect-cooleffect

Type=Service
X-KDE-ServiceTypes=KWin/Effect
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Author=My Name
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Email=my@email.here
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name=kwin4_effect_cooleffect
X-KDE-PluginInfo-Category=Misc
X-KDE-Library=kwin4_effect_cooleffect
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * @section accessing Accessing windows and workspace
 * Effects can gain access to the properties of windows and workspace via
 *  EffectWindow and EffectsHandler classes.
 *
 * There is one global EffectsHandler object which you can access using the
 *  @ref effects pointer.
 * For each window, there is an EffectWindow object which can be used to read
 *  window properties such as position and also to change them.
 *
 * For more information about this, see the documentation of the corresponding
 *  classes.

/**
 * @short Base class for all KWin effects
 *
 * This is the base class for all effects. By reimplementing virtual methods
 *  of this class, you can customize how the windows are painted.
 *
 * The virtual methods of this class can broadly be divided into two
 *  categories: the methods used for painting and those you can use to be
 *  notified and react to certain events, e.g. that a window was closed.
 *
 * @section Chaining
 * Most methods of this class are called in chain style. This means that when
 *  effects A and B area active then first e.g. A::paintWindow() is called and
 *  then from within that method B::paintWindow() is called (although
 *  indirectly). To achieve this, you need to make sure to call corresponding
 *  method in EffectsHandler class from each such method (using @ref effects
 *  pointer):
 * @code
 *  void MyEffect::postPaintScreen()
 *  {
 *      // Do your own processing here
 *      ...
 *      // Call corresponding EffectsHandler method
 *      effects->postPaintScreen();
 *  }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section Effectsptr Effects pointer
 * @ref effects pointer points to the global EffectsHandler object that you can
 *  use to interact with the windows.
 *
 * @section painting Painting stages
 * Painting of windows is done in three stages:
 * @li First, the prepaint pass.<br>
 *  Here you can specify how the windows will be painted, e.g. that they will
 *  be translucent and transformed.
 * @li Second, the paint pass.<br>
 *  Here the actual painting takes place. You can change attributes such as
 *  opacity of windows as well as apply transformations to them. You can also
 *  paint something onto the screen yourself.
 * @li Finally, the postpaint pass.<br>
 *  Here you can mark windows, part of windows or even the entire screen for
 *  repainting to create animations.
 *
 * For each stage there are *Screen() and *Window() methods. The window method
 *  is called for every window which the screen method is usually called just
 *  once.

/**
 * @short Wrapper class for using timelines in KWin effects.
 *
 * This class provides an easy and specialised interface for
 * effects that want a non-linear timeline. Currently, most
 * it does is wrapping QTimeLine. In the future, this class
 * could help using physics animations in KWin.
 *
 * KWin effects will usually use this feature by keeping one
 * TimeLine per animation, for example per effect (when only
 * one animation is done by the effect) or per windows (in
 * the case that multiple animations can take place at the
 * same time (such as minizing multiple windows with a short
 * time offset. Increasing the internal time state of the
 * TimeLine is done either by changing the 'current' time in
 * the TimeLine, which is an int value between 0 and the
 * duration set (defaulting to 250msec). The current time
 * can also be changed by setting the 'progress' of the
 * TimeLine, a double between 0.0 and 1.0. setProgress(),
 * addProgress(), addTime(), removeTime() can all be used to
 * manipulate the 'current' time (and at the same time
 * progress) of the TimeLine.
 *
 * The internal state of the TimeLine is determined by the
 * duration of the TimeLine, int in milliseconds, defaulting.
 * the 'current' time and the current 'progress' are
 * interchangeable, both determine the x-axis of a graph
 * of a TimeLine. The value() returned represents the y-axis
 * in this graph.
 *
 * m_TimeLine.setProgress(0.5) would change the 'current'
 * time of a default TimeLine to 125 msec. m_TimeLine.value()
 * would then return the progress value (a double between 0.0
 * and 1.0), which can be lower than 0.5 in case the animation
 * should start slowly, such as for the EaseInCurve.
 * In KWin effect, the prePaintWindow() or prePaintScreen()
 * methods have int time as one of their arguments. This int
 * can be used to increase the 'current' time in the TimeLine.
 * The double the is subsequently returned by value() (usually
 * in paintWindow() or paintScreen() methods can then be used
 * to manipulate windows, or their positions.
